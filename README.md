##Javier's Bloc Jams with Angular


BlocJams is web app that simulates an online, music streaming service. It was built with AngularJS and Buzz library.

To get started simply clone repository and run "grunt" from the command line.

Then go to "http://localhost:3000/"

Cheers!

This code uses:

• AngularJS for UI

• [Buzz library](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) to play songs

• Grunt for development environment
